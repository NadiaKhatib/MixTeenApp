# Why 🙋  
## Proplem : 

When we thought of a site idea we searched for sites that teach children programming and we studied them and we read the comments that want parents to be and suffer from them
Such as Scratch and wanted most parents to have clear learning to walk the child
Such as Kodable was lacking for the Arabic language
Some people have asked for a simple site where children can easily navigate
It is easy to play and learn 

* Important reasons for learning Programming for children:  

   1- Coding is the future.  
   2- Creative Thinking.  
   3- Solve Problems.  
   4- Courage to try new things.  

## Solution :
We thought of a simple solution that attracted children to programming in a fun and interested way
Enjoy learning programming and at the same time enjoy the game
They will play it through the code they write.
